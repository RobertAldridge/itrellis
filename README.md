# website
I need a generic ASP.NET template web site, which I will eventually clone off to implement UI front-end to access various WCF service.  I'm starting with the template ASP.NET Web Forms Site.  It seems a bit cumbersome and overbearing, hopefully I can slim it down to its core while still maintaining all the functionality I need.
